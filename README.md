# CTF-Creator

The Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-Creator is a Python-based project designed to automate the setup of a CTF environment by managing Docker containers, networking, and security configurations. It simplifies the process of provisioning resources for multiple users, ensuring each participant has a dedicated and secure environment tailored to the CTF requirements and creating OpenVPN files for a secure connection with the CTF environment.

By integrating with Docker, SSH, and networking tools, the main function facilitates the creation of isolated environments where participants can engage in challenges, exercises, or simulations typical of CTF competitions. This automation not only saves time but also enhances the scalability and consistency of CTF environments across different hosts and setups.

## Folders and Files

The project consists of three folders:
1. **src**: Where all relevant files and scripts are:
    - `ctf_main.py` : Contains the main function.
    - `docker_functions.py`
    - `pyyaml_functions.py'`
    - `hosts_functions.py`
    - `ovpn_helper_functions.py`
    - `pyyaml_functions.py`
    - `readme_functions.py`
    - `validation_functions.py`
    - `test.yaml` : YAML Configuration file

2. **tests**: Contains several `pyyaml` tests to verify the functionalities of the CTF-creator.
3. **example_generated_data**: This folder provides examples of the user data generated by the CTF-Creator to connect to the CTF environment. Each user has their own folder named user_user_name, which contains:

   - `client.ovpn`: An OVPN configuration file for connecting to the secure CTF environment.
   - `README.md`: Explains how to use the client.ovpn file.
   - `dockovpn_data.tar`: Backup data for the OpenVPN server.

## Installation Instructions

Python 3 and several Python libraries need to be installed:
    - 

**Recommendation**: Before running `ctf_main.py`, create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
## Requirements 
Provide a YAML configuration file with the following arguments:

    -     `name`: Name of the YAML configuration (e.g., my_config).
    -     `containers`: Docker containers that get started for each user in a specific subnet isolated from other users (e.g., nginx:latest).
    -     `users`: List of users of the CTF environment created by the CTF-Creator.
    -     `identityFile`: Path to the private SSH keys for host logins.
    -     `hosts`: Hosts where the Docker containers for the CTF environment are running. Entries should start with the host username, followed by @, and then the IP address of the host (e.g., ubuntu@10.20.30.101).
    -     `subnet_first_part`: First segment of the subnet IP address (e.g., 10 in 10.xx.xx.xx/24).
    -     `subnet_second_part`: Second segment of the subnet IP address. (e.g., 13 in xx.13.xx.xx/24).
    -     `subnet_third_part`: Third segment of the subnet IP address (e.g., 0 in xx.xx.0.xx/24).
   
    An example YAML config file named test.yaml is available in the src directory to illustrate the required structure.

### Requirements for the remote hosts that are specified in the YAML configuration 
The hosts need to be capable of spawning Docker containers. For that please follow the instructions: 
1. You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
2. You need to configure [remote access Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/remote-access/)
3. You need to be able to use Docker without privilaged Access run follwoing comand in the terminal of the remote hosts ```
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami) && newgrp docker  ```      

The hosts need to support SSH connections using asymmetric public and private keys for secure remote access.

## Usage
Run ctf_main.py with Python 3 in the src folder on your system.

Provide the location of your YAML configuration file and where you want to store the created data for the connection to the CTF environment on your device.

Due to the use of an SSH agent for the Connection to the hosts, you will also be prompted to enter your terminal password.

## Testing
To run all tests at once you can run this command in the terminal in the main folder `ctf-creator/`:
```bash
python3 -m pytest -v 
```

## Features

#### Main Function Overview

The main function orchestrates the entire setup process for the CTF-Creator, using various helper functions and external libraries like Docker, Paramiko (SSH), and Click (command-line interface).
Key Functionalities:
        1.    YAML Configuration Parsing:
        2.    SSH Connection Initialization: 
        3.    Host Reachability and SSH Connectivity Check:
        4.    Cleanup of Existing Docker Containers and Networks:
        5.    Subnet Calculation and Network Setup:
        6.    OpenVPN Server Setup:
        7.    OpenVPN Configuration Management: 
        8.    Docker Container Deployment:
        9.    Documentation and Output Generation:
        10.   Error Handling and Logging:
