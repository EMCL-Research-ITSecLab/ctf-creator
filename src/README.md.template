# OpenVPN Connection Instructions

Dear {user},


To connect to the desired subnet, use the following command: "sudo openvpn client.ovpn"

Once connected, you can only reach the Docker containers within the subnet. The possible reachable IP addresses with `ping` are:

- {subnet}.1
- {subnet}.2

Good luck, and may the flags be ever in your favor!
