# Welcome to the IT-Security Capture the Flag (CTF) Games!

Dear {user},

Each flag you capture brings you one step closer to victory, but bewareâ€”every puzzle is more cunning than the last.
To connect to the desired exercise, use the following command: `sudo openvpn client.ovpn`

Once connected, you can only reach the Docker containers within the subnet.
Be aware, the IP addresses are not statically set, each user has different IPs for the challenge.

Good luck, and may the flags be ever in your favor!

## Details

Connection has been tested with OpenVPN version: `2.5.11`
